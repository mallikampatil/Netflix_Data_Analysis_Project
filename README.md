3. Step 3: DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS

5. Step 5: INTERPRET THE DATA
Based on this model, should Netflix spend $10,000 on the distribution rights for Weeds in Canada? 
Ans: Yes, since there is a similar correlation, we feel that US is a good proxy for Canada. 

## Results
As seen from the results, it is very likely that a user who watches Weeds will also enjoy Mad Men seen from the positive correlation.

# Netflix Data Challenge

1. Clean the data
Ex: Remove any cases where someone left and did not keep watching

2. Create the pivot table

3. Get the correlation coefficient
Ex: How many people that watched Lost also watched Lorax? 

4. Interpret the Data
Based on this model, should Netflix spend $10,000 on the distribution rights for Weeds in Canada? 
Ans: Yes, since there is a similar correlation, we feel that US is a good proxy for Canada.
